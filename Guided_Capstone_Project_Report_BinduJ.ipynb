    "# Project report -  Big Mountain Resort\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Mountain resort, a ski resort in Montana had recently installed a chair lift which increases their operating cost by \\\\$1,540,000 this season. The resort needs pricing guidance on how to select a better value for their ticket price, so that they can consider a number of changes that will either cut costs without undermining the ticket price or will support an even higher ticket price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Mountain suspects it may not be maximizing its returns, relative to its position in the market. It also does not have a strong sence of what facilities matter most to visitors, particularly which ones they're most likely to pay for. "

    "\n",
    "In cleaning the data, we find that just over 82% of resorts have no missing ticket price, 3% are missing one value, and 14% are missing both. So these 14% (about 47) resorts that have no price data are removed from the dataset.\n",

    "1. SkiableTerrain_ac value for Silverton Mountain Resort in Colorado was changed after a web search\n",
    "2. Heavenly Mountain Resort in California has a suspect skiable area value and no ticket pricing information,so data for this resort was removed\n",
    "3. fastEight values for all the resorts were removed as half the values were missing\n",
    "4. yearsOpen has a maximum of 2019, which strongly suggests someone recorded calendar year rather than number of years. So this resort data was removed\n",
    "5. Removing rows which does not contain weekday price.\n",
    "6. Removing AdultWeekday price, as Big Mountain charges ($81) the same price for both weekend and weekday. Hence only AdultWeekend price is considered."

Population and total area data for each US states are obtained from wikipedia and added to this data. So the final data contains 277 different ski resort information.\n",
    "\n",
    "After visualizing the data using PCA and using a scatter plot to see the distribution of the states with additional information about the average price, there is not an obvious pattern between state and ticket price and the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful. So can treat all states equally and work towards building a pricing model that considers all states together."

Since the modelled price shows that the resort was undercharging, we needed to find out if there was any missing key data in our dataset. Since we lack data regarding the operating cost of runs and weekday pricing, we cannot recommend closing down any runs"
